A small, basic raytracer written in, I hope, clear and clean
C code.
The most 'interesting' bits are in ray.c I guess :-)
(No, don't expect anything revolutionary, it's just the standard
half assed ray-tracing code)

Controls:
Mouse movement controls x,y of light[0]
mouse wheel controlz light[0] z coordinate
(fine tune with arrow keys + pageup/down)
